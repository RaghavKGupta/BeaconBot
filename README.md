### 📦 Deployment Options

#### 🔁 One-Click Vercel Deployment

> ⚠️ Before pushing to production, **remove** the seed script from your Vercel build settings.

#### 🧪 Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/beaconbot.git
   cd beaconbot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file with the following:**

   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT=https://your-astra-endpoint
   ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN=AstraCS:your_token_here
   ASTRA_DB_NAMESPACE=your_keyspace (optional)
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key
   AWS_REGION=us-east-1
   S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-s3-bucket
   S3_PREFIX=pdfs/
   ```
4. ## 📄 Ingesting PDFs from S3

   BeaconBot includes tooling to extract PDF content from AWS S3 and convert it into structured JSON format used for training, search, or vectorization.
   
   ### 📥 How it Works
   
   Run the following script to:
   - Connect to your AWS S3 bucket
   - Parse PDFs into text using getPdf.ts
   - Generate structured JSON with `url`, `title`, `content`
   - Append new entries (avoiding duplicates) to `scripts/data.json`
   
   ```bash
   npm run getPdfsFromS3
   ```


5. **Seed the database (development only):**

   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

6. **Start the dev server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
